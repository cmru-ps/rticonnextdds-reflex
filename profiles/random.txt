Interesting random numbers for property-based testing of RefleX.

The random numbers in this file result in to deeply nested generated
types due to compile-time type-generators. 

For the implementation of compile-time type generators, please see the
following files.

Build command
============
make -f make/Makefile.i86Linux-gcc CXX=g++5 CXXSTD=c++14 RANDOM=$RANDOM prop_test

Good numbers
===========

31415  ( 3 nested)
32415  (51 nested)
2626   (12 nested)
10295  (15 nested)
21525  (41 nested)

Bad Numbers
===========

2152 (test seg-faults)
sizeof(tuple) > 2750 KB! Can't create even a single instance of the std::tuple.
Fails on 64 bit machines as well.

20163 (run-time error)
Size of tuple = 9728
DDS_DynamicData_set_long_array:type mismatch for field m1 (id=2)
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  set_member_value: Error setting array, error = DDS_RETCODE_ILLEGAL_OPERATION
Aborted (core dumped)
== Can't start debugging because gdb fails to load all the symbols.

{"name":"RefleX","tagline":"Reflection-based Type Modeling for DDS-XTypes","body":"### Welcome to \r\n\r\n![RefleX Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-reflex/master/www/reflex-log-small.png)\r\n\r\nRefleX is a short for Reflection for DDS-XTypes. The main objective of this library is to create DDS-XTypes compliant types and data directly from native C++ types. RefleX is declarative–i.e., it is not a reflection API. There is no separate code generation step involved (other than compilation). The RefleX library will take your application-level datatypes in C++ and will happily map them to equivalent DDS topic types.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nConsider the following simple `ShapeType` class.\r\n```cpp\r\nclass ShapeType \r\n{\r\n  std::string color_;\r\n  int x_, y_, shapesize_;\r\n\r\npublic:\r\n  ShapeType() {}\r\n  ShapeType(const std::string & color,\r\n            int x, int y, int shapesize)\r\n    : color_(color), x_(x), y_(y),\r\n      shapesize_(shapesize)\r\n  {}\r\n    \r\n  std::string & color() { return color_;     }\r\n  int & x()             { return x_;         }\r\n  int & y()             { return y_;         }\r\n  int & shapesize()     { return shapesize_; }\r\n      \r\n  const std::string & color() const { return color_;     }\r\n  const int & x()             const { return x_;         }\r\n  const int & y()             const { return y_;         }\r\n  const int & shapesize()     const { return shapesize_; }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nTo send and receive instances of this class using DDS, simply add the `RTI_ADAPT_STRUCT` macro below. Note that `color` is the key.\r\n```cpp\r\n#include \"reflex.h\"\r\n\r\nRTI_ADAPT_STRUCT(\r\n  ShapeType,\r\n  (std::string, color(), RTI_KEY)\r\n  (int,             x())\r\n  (int,             y())\r\n  (int,     shapesize()))\r\n```\r\nThe `ShapeType` class and its objects can now be used with RTI Connext DDS. Here's the `main` program that writes a `ShapeType` objects. `GenericDataWriter` is an thin shim layer to simplify using DDS DataWriter with RefleX. It is not mandatory, however. \r\n```cpp\r\nint main (void)\r\n{\r\n  // ... setup participant\r\n\r\n  reflex::GenericDataWriter<ShapeType>\r\n      writer(participant, \"Square\");\r\n  ShapeType shape(\"BLUE\", 10, 20, 30);\r\n  writer.write(shape);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nRefleX maps the `ShapeType` class to the following `ShapeType` IDL, which is interoperable with the Shapes Demo.\r\n```cpp\r\nstruct ShapeType\r\n{\r\n    string<128> color; //@key\r\n    long x;\r\n    long y;\r\n    long shapesize;\r\n};//@Extensibility EXTENSIBLE_EXTENSIBILITY\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What powers RefleX?\r\nThe Reflex library uses powerful C++ meta-programming (templates and the preprocessor) machinery to iterate over the members of the user-defined type and synthesizes equivalent `TypeObject` representation for the type and `DynamicData` representation for the state. `RTI_ADAPT_STRUCT` macro acts as a substitute for reflection in C++. It is not the kind of reflection in the Java/C# world. It is a macro, which opens the guts of the specified type to the RefleX library (take a [look](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-reflex/blob/master/test/shape_type_adapt.h)). The key difference is that the process of reflection happens at compile-time. As a consequence, there is no run-time performance penalty for using reflection. The resulting on-the-wire type description is fully compatible with an equivalent type described in IDL. Needless to say, they interoperate.\r\n\r\n### C++ Types Supported by RefleX\r\n\r\n* All fundamental types, arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, enumerations\r\n* Struct (with public members) ([example](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-reflex/blob/master/test/many_members.h))\r\n* Classes (with setter/getter) ([example](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-reflex/blob/master/test/shape_type.h))\r\n* Nested struct/classes ([example](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-reflex/blob/master/test/darkart.h))\r\n* Standard Template Library (STL) `string`, `vector`, `list`, `set`, `map`, `array`, `tuple`, `pair`, iterators, etc. \r\n* Raw pointer, smart pointers\r\n* User-defined/custom containers(e.g., those that expose STL-compatible iterators)\r\n* Lazy container adapters (e.g., boost.Iterators)\r\n* Class inheritance ([example](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-reflex/blob/master/test/shape_type.h))\r\n* Most combinations of the above \r\n\r\n### Advantages of RefleX\r\n\r\n1. **Native Types (IDL-free):** IDL representation of DDS types is no longer necessary. Adapted C++ types declarations in the headers are sufficient. With RefleX, you are free to use C++ standard library types, such as STL containers, custom iterators, `shared_ptr`, `auto_ptr`, `unique_ptr`, etc. The RefleX library has a predefined mapping for each and you can also define your own mapping. \r\n\r\n2. **Declarative Dynamic Data:** `DynamicData` and `TypeCode` objects can be created declaratively as opposed to procedurally, which quickly gets laborious and repetitive as the complexity of the type increases. Many times, types are known statically but no code generation support is available (e.g., RTI Routing Service adapters). With RefleX, creating a TypeCode and populating a DynamicData object is never more than one line of code!\r\n\r\n3. **Third-party code generators:** Classes generated by third-party code generation tools can be mapped to DDS topic types. The key is that RefleX works directly off of C++ types. The generated types may use a wide variety of types (e.g., boost containers, custom iterators, etc.). RefleX provides a way to map such types directly to a DDS. For example, with RefleX the types generated by a third-party XSD to C++ compiler can be mapped to DDS by adding an `RTI_ADAPT_STRUCT` macro for each generated type. See an [example](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-reflex/blob/master/test/osacbm/driver.cxx) of mapping [OSA-CBM XSD](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-reflex/tree/master/test/osacbm/mimosa-osa-cbm-v03-3-1/V3.3.1/02-XSD) to DDS using the [Code Synthesis](http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/) open-source code generator. \r\n\r\n4. **Glue code:** Glue code must often be written because wire-level types may not always match with the application-level types. RefleX allows direct use of application-level types with DDS. Glue code is nearly eliminated.\r\n\r\n5. **Performance:** Users of complex XML vocabularies (e.g., XSD) often serialize data to plain-text XML before writing it out to DDS. Such an approach incurs significant performance penalty as data is serialized twice. RefleX does only one serialization as the underlying DynamicData representation is already serialized. \r\n\r\n### Download and Build\r\n#### Linux gcc 4.8, clang 3.3 or better\r\n1. export REFLEXHOME, BOOSTHOME (1.46+) and NDDSHOME (5.0.0+)\r\n2. export ARCH=i86Linux2.6gcc4.4.5, for example.

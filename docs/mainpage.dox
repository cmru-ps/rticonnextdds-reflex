\mainpage RefleX: Reflection for DDS X-Types

\image html reflex-logo-small.png 

RefleX is short for Reflection for DDS-XTypes. The main objective 
of this library is to create DDS-XTypes compliant types and data 
directly from native C++ types. RefleX is declarativeâ€“i.e., it is 
not a reflection API. There is no separate code generation step 
involved (other than compilation). The RefleX library will take 
your application-level datatypes in C++ and will happily map them 
to equivalent DDS topic types.

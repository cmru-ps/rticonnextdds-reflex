Property-based testing for RefleX
Interesting random numbers for property-based testing of RefleX.

The random numbers in this file result in to deeply nested structured 
types due to compile-time type-generators.

Linux build command
===================
make -f make/Makefile.x64Linux-gcc CXX=g++5 CXXSTD=c++14 RANDOM=$RANDOM prop_test

Visual Studio build command
===========================
1. cd to rticonnextdds-reflex
2. Make sure you have added "/D RANDOM_SEED=$(RANDOM_SEED)" as an additional  
   compiler option in the "Release|x64" build configuration.
3. Run random\vsrand.bat
4. Check out (locally generated) RANDOM_SEEDS.txt 

Good numbers
===========
2626    (1 struct)
18008   (2 structs)
18911   (2 structs)
23636   (2 structs)
21525   (2 structs)
15034   (3 structs)
3245    (4 structs)
12758   (4 structs)
7937    (6 structs)
5014    (6 structs)
12414   (7 structs)
17715   (8 structs)
21294   (8 structs)
4936   (15 structs)
5071   (17 structs)
9126   (28 structs)
19846  (44 structs)
2152  (667 structs) See random\tuple_2152.txt 

Bad Numbers
===========
10338 (47 structs. DynamicData internal error)
15212 (member size exceeds 65535 bytes)
16808 (Evil. compilation does not finish on VS2015)
11261 (24 structs. DynamicData internal error)
5887  (4 structs roundtrip false)
7606  (very large)

10338 (47 structs) DynamicData internal error
